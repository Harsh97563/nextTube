YouTube Clone Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.
Overview

Welcome to our YouTube Clone project! This project aims to create a refined version of YouTube that focuses on enhancing user experience by providing more relevant video recommendations. Instead of random content, our platform will prioritize videos from subscribed channels and curated playlists, ensuring a more personalized viewing experience. Moreover, we aim to keep the platform ad-free, with the potential to add more exciting features in the future.
Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
